-----------------

General Life update - cause you have ran out of memory since last year I guess - it's a pain.

Nov 2024- get consulted for depression again (last time was 2021), start meds late nov. still cribbing about my boring crap writing job that is too convenient for me to quit and do something good for myself. stuck in writing because I had work ex in this when I got detained in 2022. so to make more money had to stick to this. remote + good pay = good life , but I was depressed - rotting everyday - smoking to cope.

Dec 2024 - homeless because one of the tenants left and we were asked to pay rent or leave. find a sublet for 20k -> move in temporarily while I look for places.

this place has millions of windows, and tons of cats in the area. my cat becomes peak horny - for the first time - and goes out to find a girl - cries 24/7 literally howling it was painful to hear - peeing everywhere.. so I find and find and lock in this place for 13k/month - super cheap - smaller room but bigger house. get my cat neutered and move in to this place as I am working remote so the location doesn't matter.


- Jan 2025 - I decide to resume my meds properly (skipped it on a lot of days in dec) and fix my life fr, my job is fully remote - so I have complete opportunity to do something good for myself. but I spend the whole month gaming and vaping and smoking up here and there sometimes - and chugging 100s of energy drinks

- Feb 2025 - my birthday on 4/2 - so I decide to get high and drink energy drinks - one last time I say. birthday's over - job's still boring - and I am doing fucking nothing. 

11/2 - I quit valorant - this cursed game. 
14/2 - I apply for a passport renewal - considering moving to UK (very unseriously)
2 weeks pass - and I realize I have replaced gaming with smoking up everyday - I wasn't smoking up at all earlier. End of feb I bought a new bong, a herb mix, and even a box of 40 bhang edibles. I bought a new vape juice. And I enjoyed for 2 days and then - decided to fuck it.

6/3 - I quit pot - I am like I won't smoke up again (very unseriously considering I have bought so much shit)
7/3 - I realize why I am unsuccessful in quitting these and go for the trifecta - quit vaping - energy drinks and pot at the same time - nothing feeding into each other. I quit music, I quit every single thing that is artificial dopamine. 

I buy cold brew medium roast grounds, a French press - start making black coffee (quitting milk). I give up on every single thing and take my meds (bupropion) that is supposed to stop cravings of nicotine etc along with anti depressant

I go running everyday on the street to feel alive. Can't commit to gym in such an early stage of quitting. 

I start coding to build my streaming platform - and somehow also to build an analysis tool (python) for my job - somehow I had to do some tech related thing in my writing job - boss convinced gives me more tech tasks - makes me the lead for developing a crypto analytics tool as a last resort of saving this doomed company where 90%people have been laid off and more will be soon.


I am suffering but getting by day by day - I finally get a passport appointment scheduled- I haven't even thought of the universities or what the process is yet. I am a rotting memoryless being - trying to be human for the first time in 4 years. I came to this city to escape the childhood trauma from Chennai - smoked weed to experience dopamine but after 1.5 years it somehow disappeared- my receptors no longer gave a fuck about the chemical but still needed them to function. 

March ends - I have done my passport renewal thing - which is  big step for me - making it real, I join the cult gym near me on April 1st as I am convinced this attempt to change my life is real and nothing bad is going to happen like it always does (people dying, covid, or even homelessness+neutering craze) when I try to change.


April 1st week I apply to Warwick, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bristol, Birmingham, Exeter, Liverpool etc for Msc in Financial Technology September Intake. (in this order of priority)

April - I code, assign work to team, gym, etc. 
April 19 - I find out that he cannot secure funding so the company might shut by May end. - the inevitable end of everything - but I don't give up.

May happens - I go to Chennai again a few times get my passport finally. Give IELTS, Add funds to bank etc. Get the news that it's not going to work out by may 15th (1 week of work left) 

Glasgow gave offer but rejected after backlogs (sadly it was all skipping exams and not failing but anyway) , warwick rejected without any consideration. Everyone else unconditional.

Leaning towards Bristol - but no scholarship - 39k fees and higher living expense- no way to justify spending 2-3lakhs on my cat to come with me. I choose Birmingham - a big compromise cause I hate the word Birmingham- I think it's just going to be India Pt 2 - and I am extremely worried it'll be a waste of money - but it's the most cost effective ROI with 27510 fees and lower living exp

I pay deposit for Birmingham may 28th. I am unemployed officially.. I look for jobs - I give interviews etc - nothing working out really. My location is too far for some jobs- and some jobs are too boring to accept. I have savings to survive till August 1st week so I don't focus that much. 

I start focusing on achievement highs - transferring funds - creating student forex cards, UK Bank account, iQ booking happens in this month I struggle and it is the only place allowing pets in Birmigham crazy - as an ESA that too. I book it , I do more logistics. Since April I was working on MeshOS - a personal life organizer - agentic os that fixes my life - tracks habits, finance, tasks, content, grocery, everything about me - on and off I code for it - 50+ commits etc. GitHub hits 300+ in this short span. 
I start giving up on the coding.

I do more logistics - ordering things, creating plans, finding best way to pay fees, etc. But it's all done. Even now (today I ordered neeman's and urban monkey belt) - I am dragging this shopping high.


My sister came to visit me in the week of July 14-20
I hadn't vaped, smoked up or anything in the last 130 days. It was a bit extreme because my initial goal was a short tolerance break - not saint stage 1. I had full plans of smoking on day 100 but I couldn't go through it. Everyday I was getting dreams of smoking up , vaping - and in my dream I count the days and feel guilty and wake up.

Still regular with the gym etc. So I decide to smoke up with her to get rid of this thought once and for all - I smoke up - 7-8 rips maybe and 11 puffs of my vape. I eat some candies and food and then go to sleep. I don't touch any of these substances the next day. and haven't so far. It's July 31st now. 

I am struggling to do things with the day beyond eating a ton of protein - focusing too much on my physique - because I am a 5'5" skinny guy and will get bullied big time with the Indian stereotype based on the corny people going to UK (500+ in the Birmingham WhatsApp group - all clowns)

Gained 4.5kgs weight since April. But coding from June 19th (even June was lower than May but still) - till July 6th nothing - biggest break. then nothing since July 15th to now. I cannot give a fuck about this project of mine. I cannot care about anything - I am optimistic about my move - and I am going to be fine with the money - will pay rent using deposit and survive on savings till sep 14th. not an issue.

I need more achievement highs - more things to do.
My days go like - Wake up whenever - sometimes super early - mostly afternoons nowadays because I am awake at night (its 3am). I eat breakfast-> pre workout-> gym-> protein shake + lunch + shower-> watch content - rot - do logistics or order things and go to sleep. or I rant to you about some crap.

anyway end of recap
______________

______________


I need you to tell me what is left to do (you know why I Want to know - I just need to do things please) - and help me become sane. I want to be happy ffs - but all my dopamine is food+tv+gym - it feels more artificial than substance abuse.
