Part 2 — The New Vision (Clear, Grounded, Not Grandiose)

You asked for a document framing the vision properly.

Here it is.

MeshOS – Executive Function Prosthetic
What It Is

MeshOS is not a productivity app.

It is a prosthetic layer for executive function.

It does not try to optimize output.
It tries to make daily life traversable.

Who It Is For

People who:

Struggle to initiate tasks

Freeze under ambiguity

Collapse after small deviations

Need structure but reject rigid productivity culture

Have ADHD traits, autistic traits, depression, or chronic overwhelm

What It Is Not

Not a motivational app

Not a life optimization machine

Not an AI life coach

Not a dopamine-driven habit tracker

Not a corporate task manager

Not surveillance disguised as self-help

Core Philosophy

Dependency over time minimization
The goal is to help users internalize structure, not rely forever.

Chain integrity over punctuality
Completing required steps matters more than perfect timing.

Clarity over optimization
The app reduces ambiguity instead of maximizing efficiency.

User agency first
The user decides structure. The app enforces nothing.

Data stays yours
No behavioral monetization. No manipulation loops.

Part 3 — How It Actually Helps Executive Dysfunction

Your current architecture is already doing some important things right.

What You’re Doing Right
1. Anchor-Based Structuring

Life revolves around immovable commitments.
This reduces ambiguity.

Huge.

2. Execution Chains

You are externalizing sequencing.
That directly addresses executive dysfunction.

3. Exit Gate

Checklist before leaving = reduces transition failures.

Very good.

4. Recovery Buffers

You recognize transitions are costly.
Most apps ignore this.

5. Wake Ramp Concept

Acknowledges activation energy.
That’s neurodivergent-aware.

What You Haven’t Fully Considered Yet

These are not feature spam ideas.
These are structural.

1. Collapse Mode

When user misses anchor:

Instead of:
“Failure”

Switch to:
“Recovery Chain”

Example:

Eat

Shower

Reset

Pick 1 small win

This prevents full spiral.

This is huge.

2. Energy-Based Templates

Instead of planning based on time,
Allow planning based on:

Low energy

Medium energy

High energy

Chain changes based on energy, not ambition.

3. Weekly Stability Score (Not Productivity Score)

Track:

Sleep consistency

Anchor attendance

Collapse recoveries

Not:
“Tasks completed.”

This changes psychological framing.

4. Manual Override Philosophy

Every automation should be overrideable.

User clicks:
“Actually today is chaos”

System relaxes.

No guilt.

5. De-Tech Dependency Safeguards

You’re worried about dependency.

So build in:

Printable daily chain

“No phone mode”

Weekly structure export

Gradual reduction mode

App trains the user to function without it.

That’s radical.

Part 4 — How To Make It Shareable Without Embarrassment

You don’t need commercial polish.

You need:

1. Clean Landing Page

Simple.

Not grand.

Example:

MeshOS
A prosthetic for executive function.
Not productivity. Stability.

Short explanation.
3 screenshots.
Done.

2. Onboarding

Ask only 4 questions:

Do you have fixed commitments?

Do you struggle with starting?

Do you prefer structure or flexibility?

What time do you usually wake?

Then generate a demo chain.

3. Modules in Development

Don’t hide them.
Label clearly:

“Coming Soon — Finance”
“Coming Soon — Health”
“Experimental”

Honesty beats fake polish.

Part 5 — About Competition (Tiimo etc.)

You are not competing on:

Features

Funding

Awards

You compete on:

Philosophy + architecture.

Most neurodivergent apps:

Add more reminders

Add more AI

Add more nudges

You are removing chaos, not adding noise.

That’s your lane.

Part 6 — Important Reality Check

You don’t need to beat anyone.

You need:

10 users who say
“This helps me.”

That’s enough.

Part 7 — Your Real Danger

Not competition.

Not commercialization.

Not feature gaps.

Your real danger:

Trying to fix your entire life before sharing.

Perfection paralysis is executive dysfunction disguised as engineering.
