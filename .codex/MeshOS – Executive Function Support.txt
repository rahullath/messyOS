MeshOS – Executive Function Support Framework
Version: Human-First / Low-Dependency Architecture
Core Philosophy

MeshOS should:

Externalize executive load temporarily

Reduce chaos, not replace decision-making

Support autonomy, not create reliance

Be progressively reducible over time

The goal is:

Make the user stronger — not more dependent.

Feature Evaluation Matrix

Each feature is evaluated on:

🧠 EF Impact (Executive Function support)

⚙️ Technical Feasibility

🔗 Dependency Risk

✅ Recommendation

CATEGORY 1 — Execution Structure (High Value, Low Dependency)
1. Chain-Based Execution (Keep)

What it does:
Externalizes sequencing and dependencies.

🧠 EF Impact: Very High
⚙️ Feasibility: Already built
🔗 Dependency Risk: Low

Why dependency risk is low:

It does not decide life.

It only makes sequence visible.

User can ignore it.

✅ Keep as core feature.

2. Exit Readiness Gate (Keep)

Binary prerequisite checklist before leaving.

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Built
🔗 Dependency Risk: Low

This reduces cognitive load.
It does not remove autonomy.

✅ Keep.

3. Duration Priors (Keep, Invisible)

Uses historical medians for timing realism.

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Implemented
🔗 Dependency Risk: Very Low

User is not relying on app to estimate life —
It just prevents self-deception.

✅ Keep.

4. Risk Inflators (Keep, Subtle)

Inflates duration if low energy or sleep debt.

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Built
🔗 Dependency Risk: Very Low

No spoon-feeding.
Just adaptive realism.

✅ Keep.

CATEGORY 2 — Adaptive Intelligence (High Value, Moderate Risk)
5. Executive Bandwidth Meter

Calculates estimated bandwidth from sleep, habits, substances.

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Medium
🔗 Dependency Risk: Moderate

Risk:
If user starts believing the app decides whether they can function.

Mitigation:
Make it:

A suggestion

Not a limiter

Always overrideable

Recommended framing:
“Estimated cognitive load today: Low / Medium / High”

Not:
“You cannot do X today.”

✅ Build cautiously.

6. Minimal Survival Mode

When collapse detected, generate 3-step day.

🧠 EF Impact: Extremely High
⚙️ Feasibility: Medium
🔗 Dependency Risk: Moderate

Risk:
User waits for app to tell them how to survive.

Mitigation:
Make it:

User-triggered

Not auto-triggered

Manual toggle: “Today is rough”

This preserves agency.

✅ Build as manual mode.

7. Activation Energy Sequencing

Reorders chain to start with lowest activation steps.

🧠 EF Impact: Very High
⚙️ Feasibility: Medium
🔗 Dependency Risk: Low–Moderate

This doesn’t decide life.
It just smooths entry.

Dependency risk is acceptable.

✅ Strong candidate.

CATEGORY 3 — Emotional Regulation Layer (Careful Zone)
8. Micro-Regulation Prompts

2-minute breathing / reset prompts.

🧠 EF Impact: Moderate
⚙️ Feasibility: Easy
🔗 Dependency Risk: High if overused

Risk:
App becomes emotional crutch.

Mitigation:

No push notifications.

Only appears if user taps “I’m stuck.”

No AI chat therapy mode.

✅ Only as user-initiated tool.

9. AI Companion / Conversational Mode

Let’s be clear.

🧠 EF Impact: Mixed
⚙️ Feasibility: Easy
🔗 Dependency Risk: Extremely High

This is where dependency explodes.

You already fear:

autistic introverts yapping to AI instead of humans.

Correct instinct.

❌ Do not build AI companion mode.

CATEGORY 4 — Cognitive Load Reduction (Healthy Automation)
10. Decision Fatigue Reducers

Predefined shower types, meal templates, routine presets.

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Easy
🔗 Dependency Risk: Low

Important distinction:
Providing templates ≠ making decisions for user.

User still chooses template.

✅ Build.

11. Smart Task Classification (Fix Laundry Anchor Issue)

Distinguish:

Commitment events

At-home tasks

Travel-required events

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Medium
🔗 Dependency Risk: Very Low

This is structural clarity.

✅ Must build.

CATEGORY 5 — Long-Term Strength Building (Anti-Dependency Features)

These are the most important.

12. Gradual Scaffold Reduction Mode

This is powerful.

Over time:

Hide some prompts

Remove exit gates

Reduce chain guidance

User can choose:
“Reduce assistance level.”

🧠 EF Impact: Long-term High
⚙️ Feasibility: Medium
🔗 Dependency Risk: Actively Reduces Risk

This prevents app addiction.

✅ Highly recommended.

13. Weekly Reflection (Not Analytics)

Instead of:

Performance graphs

Streak obsession

Do:
“What helped this week?”
“What caused breakdowns?”

Manual reflection.

No AI.

🧠 EF Impact: High
⚙️ Feasibility: Easy
🔗 Dependency Risk: Very Low

This builds metacognition.

✅ Strong feature.

CATEGORY 6 — What To Avoid

❌ Full Life Quantification Dashboard
Becomes surveillance self-obsession.

❌ Social Comparison
No leaderboards. Ever.

❌ Gamified Streak Shame
Executive dysfunction already includes guilt.

❌ AI Therapy Mode
Dangerous territory.

❌ Over-Automation
If app schedules everything without user input,
user becomes passive.

Core Vision Clarified

MeshOS should be:

A transparent executive scaffold
that makes daily traversal survivable
without replacing the user’s agency.

Not:

A life optimizer

A therapist

A dopamine engine

A digital babysitter

The Dependency Test

For any feature ask:

If this feature disappeared tomorrow,
would the user function worse than before they installed the app?

If yes → redesign.
