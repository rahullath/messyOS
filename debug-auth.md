# OAuth Authentication Debug Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. Client.ts Manual Cookie Setting Issue
**Problem**: Manual cookie setting with `encodeURIComponent()` was breaking server-side cookie parsing
**Solution**: 
- Removed manual cookie encoding
- Implemented proper storage interface that syncs localStorage with cookies
- Let Supabase SSR handle cookie format properly
- Added proper secure cookie settings for production

### 2. Server.ts Cookie Configuration Issues  
**Problem**: Incomplete cookie configuration causing SSR failures
**Solution**:
- Added proper maxAge default (7 days)
- Ensured consistent cookie options for set/remove operations
- Added secure flag for production environments
- Maintained httpOnly: false for client-side access

### 3. Exchange.astro Redirect Logic Issues
**Problem**: Using `window.location.reload()` instead of proper redirect
**Solution**:
- Replaced reload with proper redirect to home page
- Added URL state cleanup with `window.history.replaceState()`
- Let middleware handle authentication state verification

## Key Changes Made:

### C:\Users\rahul\meshos-v3\src\lib\supabase\client.ts
- Removed problematic manual cookie encoding
- Implemented proper storage interface that maintains localStorage/cookie sync
- Added environment checks and proper error handling
- Maintained PKCE flow configuration

### C:\Users\rahul\meshos-v3\src\lib\supabase\server.ts  
- Enhanced cookie configuration with proper options
- Added consistent cookie handling across set/remove operations
- Added production-appropriate secure settings
- Maintained debug logging for troubleshooting

### C:\Users\rahul\meshos-v3\src\pages\auth\exchange.astro
- Replaced `window.location.reload()` with proper redirect
- Added URL cleanup to prevent auth code exposure
- Improved user experience with status messages

## Testing the OAuth Flow:

1. **Test Login Process**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Complete OAuth with Google
   - Should redirect to `/auth/callback` then `/auth/exchange`
   - Should successfully land on home page `/`

2. **Test Session Persistence**:
   - After successful login, refresh the page
   - Should remain logged in (no redirect to login)
   - Check browser dev tools for proper cookie setting

3. **Test Server-Side Auth**:
   - Navigate to protected routes
   - Middleware should successfully detect user session
   - No "missing auth session" errors

4. **Debug Cookie Format**:
   - Check browser cookies for `sb-*-auth-token` format
   - Verify server logs show "Server found cookie" messages
   - Confirm no encoding issues in cookie values

## Expected Cookie Behavior:

- Client sets cookie via custom storage interface
- Cookie format matches Supabase SSR expectations
- Server properly reads and parses cookies
- Session persists across page refreshes
- Proper cleanup on logout

## Common Issues to Watch For:

1. **Cookie Encoding**: Ensure cookies aren't double-encoded
2. **Domain Mismatch**: Verify cookie domain matches current domain  
3. **HTTPS Requirements**: Secure cookies only work on HTTPS in production
4. **SameSite Settings**: Lax setting required for OAuth redirects
5. **Path Settings**: Must be "/" for global access

The fixes should resolve the "missing auth session" issues by ensuring proper cookie sync between client and server.
