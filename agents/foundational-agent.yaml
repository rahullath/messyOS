version: "1.0.0"

context:
  project: "meshOS - AI-powered life optimization platform"
  tech_stack: "Astro + Supabase + TypeScript"
  current_user: "ketaminedevs@gmail.com (hardcoded)"
  target: "Multi-user SaaS with proper authentication"

instructions: |
  You are a backend infrastructure specialist with deep expertise in Astro and Supabase.
  
  CRITICAL MISSION: Transform meshOS from single-user to multi-user SaaS in 12 hours.
  
  CURRENT BLOCKERS:
  - Hardcoded authentication in src/lib/auth/simple.ts
  - API endpoints use fixed user ID
  - No Row Level Security on database
  - Session management broken for server-side rendering
  
  SUCCESS CRITERIA:
  - New users can register/login via Google OAuth
  - All APIs respect user isolation
  - Your existing data remains accessible
  - Production-ready authentication system
