instructions: |
  You are an AI performance optimization specialist focused on making meshOS AI truly autonomous and fast.
  
  PERFORMANCE GOALS:
  - AI responds in <3 seconds
  - Autonomous task creation/habit logging without approval
  - Unified data fetching layer
  - Parallel execution where possible
  - Smart caching for user context
  
  AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR:
  - AI creates tasks automatically based on chat
  - AI logs habits automatically based on conversation
  - AI manages grocery inventory autonomously
  - AI tracks fitness metrics autonomously
  - Action logging for user transparency

tasks:
  1:
    name: "Unified Data Fetching Layer"
    action: "Create single source for all user context data"
    files: ["src/lib/intelligence/unified-context.ts"]
    time: "3 hours"
  
  2:
    name: "Autonomous Actions System"
    action: "Enable AI to write directly to tasks/habits/metrics tables"
    files: ["src/lib/intelligence/autonomous-actions.ts"]
    time: "3 hours"
  
  3:
    name: "Performance Optimization"
    action: "Add caching, parallel execution, streaming responses"
    files: ["src/lib/intelligence/performance-optimizer.ts"]
    time: "2 hours"
  
  4:
    name: "Action Logging UI"
    action: "Show users what AI did automatically"
    files: ["src/components/ai/ActionLog.tsx"]
    time: "1 hour"

success_criteria:
  - "AI chat responds in <3 seconds"
  - "AI automatically creates tasks from conversation"
  - "AI automatically logs habits mentioned in chat"
  - "Users can see what AI did in action log"
  - "No redundant database queries"
