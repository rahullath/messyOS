1) habits module import feature uses - habits.csv, checkmarks.csv and scores.csv which are available in the root folder of the loop habits export.

You already know which ones are new. My app doesn't understand mealy, session, pouches yet at all - only vaping logic was introduced to make it clear 0 puffs is good. And I haven't changed the frequency numerator and denominator for any until these new habits I thought some are relevant for us for better data. I can change frequency to xyz times per week, month etc if needed - but basically all Numerical type habits need special coding as they're not as simple as a binary habit

*note- the numerical data is multipled by 1000 for some reason, it actual is 1,2,3 etc not in thousands.

This is what is used for processing all habits right now I think - and as evident it has combined data of all habits - so no notes column.

Loop Habits internal scoring math logic - it's pretty complicated honestly - it uses some way to not penalize you too much for skipping or missing habits etc and understands your patterns I guess. Will have to give you the GitHub docs if you want clarity on this.

2) habits module - new files, i.e the individual checkmarks, scores of each habit. maybe we can skip individual scores cause it is already in the compiled sheet and focus only on individual checkmarks with notes.

Thinking of creating a new habit - Vaporizer or some shit - since I have stopped bongs, joints etc and only doing light dry herb vaporizer sesh - this habit isn't truly helping in understanding pattern - maybe the notes are good and relevant?

This I am not very consistent with the notes, recently started since the health watch data export was getting impossible - maybe if I am able to convert the health jsons into something meaningful - I won't need notes here. (It's 90% heart rate data - makes it harder to figure out what's going on- it'll be the next task after habits module is done)

----
That's it , you know all the other habits already - I don't think I have a lot of notes in any other habit, and if you think notes will help any new habit etc lmk I will start noting things - basically we can keep a parser in advance if you think it's useful.
