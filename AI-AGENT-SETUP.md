# Advanced AI Agent Setup

## ðŸ§  Gemini-Powered Life Optimization Agent

Your AI agent now uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro for advanced natural language understanding, contextual memory, and intelligent task creation.

### Features Restored and Enhanced:

âœ… **Intelligent Conversation**: Natural, therapist-like responses that understand context  
âœ… **Automatic Task Creation**: AI parses your messages and creates tasks automatically  
âœ… **Advanced Habit Analysis**: Deep pattern recognition in habit data  
âœ… **Contextual Memory**: Remembers previous conversations and builds on them  
âœ… **UK Move Assistance**: Specialized knowledge for Birmingham/UK move planning  
âœ… **Energy-Based Scheduling**: Matches tasks to your energy levels throughout the day  
âœ… **Appointment Parsing**: "I have a dentist appointment tomorrow at 9:15am" â†’ automatic task creation  
âœ… **Cross-Domain Insights**: Connects patterns across tasks, habits, health, and stress  

### How It Works:

1. **Context Gathering**: Analyzes your tasks, habits, health data, and conversation history
2. **Gemini AI Processing**: Uses advanced language model to understand context and intent
3. **Action Execution**: Automatically creates tasks, provides insights, and remembers context
4. **Conversation Storage**: Builds conversational memory for better future interactions

### Example Interactions:

**Appointment Creation:**
- You: "I have a dentist appointment tomorrow morning at 9:15am for zirconia crowns"  
- AI: Creates task + preparation reminders automatically

**Task Creation:**  
- You: "Remind me to research UK bank accounts"
- AI: Creates task with appropriate category and priority

**Habit Analysis:**
- You: "How are my habits doing?"
- AI: Provides detailed analysis with specific recommendations

**Natural Conversation:**
- You: "I'm feeling overwhelmed"  
- AI: Analyzes your context and provides personalized stress management

### Database Schema:

The AI now stores conversation history in `ai_conversations` table for contextual memory. This enables:
- Remembering your preferences and patterns
- Building on previous conversations  
- Providing increasingly personalized recommendations
- Understanding your long-term goals and progress

### API Configuration:

Your Gemini API key is already configured in `.env`. The AI agent will:
- Use advanced language understanding for all interactions
- Create tasks proactively based on conversation context
- Provide therapist-like emotional intelligence
- Remember and reference previous conversations

### Testing the AI Agent:

1. Go to `/ai-agent` page
2. Try these test messages:
   - "I have a dentist appointment tomorrow at 9:15am"
   - "How are my habits looking?"
   - "I'm feeling overwhelmed with all my UK move tasks"
   - "What should I focus on today?"
   - "Create a task to research Birmingham housing"

The AI should now be significantly more intelligent, contextual, and helpful than the simple pattern-matching version.

### Credits Usage:

- Your $300 Gemini credits will provide approximately 20,000-50,000 intelligent conversations
- Each conversation uses context from your full user data for maximum personalization  
- The AI is designed to be conversational and proactive, not just reactive
