- Suggests financial optimizations

### **Cross-Domain Correlations**
- Finds hidden connections (sleep â†’ productivity â†’ spending)
- Identifies leverage points for maximum impact
- Provides holistic life optimization strategies

## ðŸ“‹ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai @langchain/community @langchain/core @langchain/google-genai @langchain/langgraph langchain zod
```

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### **Step 3: Fix Navigation**
The AI Agent is already added to your navigation. You can access it at `/ai-agent`.

### **Step 4: Test the System**
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/ai-agent` 
3. Click "Daily Check-in" for quick insights
4. Click "Deep Analysis" for comprehensive optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

### **Daily Check-in Flow**
1. **Gather Today's Data** â†’ Habits completed, current metrics
2. **Quick Analysis** â†’ Completion rate, urgent actions needed
3. **Generate Focus** â†’ One main thing to focus on today
4. **Urgent Actions** â†’ Immediate interventions if needed

### **Deep Analysis Flow**
1. **Data Collection** â†’ 30-90 days of comprehensive life data
2. **Pattern Recognition** â†’ AI identifies trends and correlations
3. **Risk Assessment** â†’ Predicts potential problems
4. **Optimization Planning** â†’ Specific, actionable recommendations
5. **Action Generation** â†’ Prioritized list of improvements

## ðŸ”¥ **Example AI Insights You'll Get**

### **Habit Insights**
- "Your gym streak is at risk. Your energy is low today - try a 10min walk instead?"
- "Coding sessions after 8 PM have 40% lower completion rate. Move to morning?"
- "You complete 85% more habits on days you sleep 7+ hours"

### **Health Correlations**
- "6.5h sleep nights lead to 40% more impulse spending"
- "High stress weeks correlate with 60% more food delivery"
- "Your heart rate is 15% higher on days you skip meditation"

### **Financial Intelligence**
- "MK Retail spending up 200% this month - stress-related?"
- "Crypto portfolio down 12% - consider DCA strategy"
- "You spend â‚¹800 more on weekends when you don't exercise"

### **Predictive Interventions**
- "Habit failure risk: 70% - Enable easy mode for gym today"
- "Spending risk: 80% - Remove payment apps from phone"
- "Sleep debt building - prioritize 9 PM wind-down tonight"

## ðŸš€ **Advanced Features**

### **Smart Notifications**
The agent can create contextual notifications:
- Habit reminders based on your optimal timing
- Stress alerts when spending risk is high
- Energy-based task suggestions

### **Automated Optimizations**
- Habit timing adjustments
- Difficulty scaling based on streaks
- Category-based spending limits
- Health metric targets

### **Learning System**
The agent learns your patterns over time:
- Remembers what works for you
- Adapts recommendations based on success
- Builds personalized optimization strategies

## ðŸ’° **Cost Efficiency**

With â‚¹25,000 in Gemini credits, you can run:
- **Daily check-ins**: ~â‚¹2-5 per analysis
- **Deep analysis**: ~â‚¹10-20 per comprehensive review
- **Monthly usage**: ~â‚¹500-1000 for regular optimization

This gives you **2+ years** of AI-powered life optimization!

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

1. **Install dependencies** and test the basic system
2. **Import your Loop Habits data** for richer analysis
3. **Add health metrics** (sleep, stress, heart rate)
4. **Run your first deep analysis** to see the magic
5. **Set up daily check-ins** for continuous optimization

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed
2. Verify your Gemini API key is set
3. Ensure your database has habit and metric data
4. Check browser console for any errors

## ðŸŒŸ **The Vision**

This AI agent will become your **personal life optimization assistant** that:
- **Learns your patterns** and predicts optimal strategies
- **Prevents problems** before they happen
- **Maximizes leverage** by finding the highest-impact changes
- **Adapts continuously** as your life evolves

You now have a **truly agentic system** that goes far beyond simple tracking - it's an intelligent partner in optimizing your entire life!
