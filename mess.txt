messyOS- 

plans for execution as of 31/7

- waitlist page, contact us page, etc - like a legit utility product landing page
- 100% customizable by the user - choose what you want to use messyOS for 

Example - 
As of today - we have  Habits, Tasks, Health, Finance and Content to be tracked, analyzed, and optimized for life.

The AI Agent can access all the data uploaded in this and talk to you everyday 

--
since this is THE everything app - it'll allow you to add
suppose news (using reuters or some other neutral reporting site), connect to your swiggy account, blinkit account, zepto account - for shopping patterns etc, connect to your GitHub if you are a dev, connect to your notion if you already use it or any other to-do app you're using, gmail integration - using gemini to streamline and summarize your weekly mail and auto add tasks, integrate a tracking tool (like aftership) to automatically track all your orders in one place

the AI model being used is the only concern - I would like to import directly the user's existing account - chatgpt has become a therapist for everyone - but without proper knowledge of prompting it will just feed into your existing ideas. make this therapist an actual agentic manager of your life.

connect outlook, gym (cultfit or whatever) , linkedin, work portals (maybe jira, Trello, or something)

the main issue is data - (when concerned with users other than me) - how will they trust my platform to upload so much data into it? I need to figure out a strong encryption thing later on. but even if everyone gives consent - there comes the issue of processing data. all of it is so vague and cannot be processed using simple code that I have written, by meshOS uses langchain and langgraph, gemini 2.5 pro credits etc - but it is still struggling to deal with properly structured data itself - dumping vague context dumps is ideally what I want users to do - everyday just yap on the notepad page or something about their day - and let the agent understand what you need - ask questions if needed , and create tasks

- you have to finish an article? the agent will suggest a pomodoro technique - ask you to choose when to start - and run the timer etc - validate your efforts even if failed

everyday this agent will help you improve your life and get better at everything you want to do

duolingo for example has been really successful in gamifying learning - but the xp points crap is not really what I am trying to do here - but would want a similar result in the user's life. 

no bloatware, you choose the theme, colours of the ui (from options ) - you choose the features (out of these 20-30 things I have talked about)- so that your screen only has things that concern you. 

free trial for all users in waitlist - autopay upi to subscribe - $1/month auto deduct after 30 day trial

these are all extremely far fetched ideas - I started building this in April (22 to be exact) - for myself. But it's already August 1st now. and I haven't been able to optimize my own life-  so it is too ambitious - but something I want to do - without consuming my entire life for it - but build and ship this product - it is already live on vercel, railway etc  by ship I mean usable with clear instructions 

for example -
habits - currently requires an import a csv file from loop habits to look good. I can make a manual new habit thing not hard but still just for context

tasks- I think works fine - but very boring - nothing that makes it unique - it starts a timer on it's own etc but still has a very low chance of people using it to manage tasks 

health - requires very specific imports ( of txt files with sleep, hearrate and steps data) which no one other than me would have

finance - requires bank statement (in the same format as my own bank's statement lol) so again not multi user friendly

content - serializd reviews txt files, serializd watched files (both I got using a python+selenium script) - and tmdb to show posters - it's the most wack of all 

ai agent itself is not bad - but again can't help me much without good data - and feels underwhelming compared to chatting with gpt or claude or any other multi billion dollar company's llm
